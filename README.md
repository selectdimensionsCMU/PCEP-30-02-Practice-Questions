# Python Practice Questions: An Interactive Study Resource

## What is it?

Python Practice Questions is an interactive web-based study tool designed to help learners prepare for Python certification exams, particularly the PCEP-30-02 (Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer). It provides a user-friendly interface for practicing multiple-choice questions related to Python programming concepts.

## How it works

1. **Question Bank**: The application loads questions from a JSON file, covering various Python topics such as operators, data types, and basic programming concepts.

2. **Interactive Quiz**: Users can select a specific topic or take a mixed quiz. Questions are presented one at a time, with multiple-choice answers.

3. **Immediate Feedback**: After submitting an answer, the application provides immediate feedback, highlighting correct and incorrect responses.

4. **Progress Tracking**: The tool keeps track of the user's progress, including the number of questions answered and the current score.

5. **Results Storage**: Quiz results are saved locally, allowing users to track their performance over time.

6. **Review Feature**: Users can review their answers after completing a quiz or return to the main menu at any time.
